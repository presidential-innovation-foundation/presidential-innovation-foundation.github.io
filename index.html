    <h3>Presidential Innovation Fellows</h3>

      <p>The world has changed significantly since our nation’s founders first sought to form a more perfect union. The challenges we face are great and incredibly complex: from saving lives when faced with natural disasters like storms, floods and even asteroids, to upgrading the infrastructure that serves our veterans, to unleashing government data to power the economy and create jobs.</p>

    <p>Presidential Innovation Fellows represent the best talent our nation has to offer to deal with the new challenges of today. As entrepreneurial leaders in design, technology and creating transformational change, fellows are asked to take on difficult, multi-headed, and technologically-oriented problems and create real and lasting impact. Fellows start each day with full knowledge that their project’s scale, scope and direction might change. Resilient in the face of uncertainty, fellows seize opportunities, untangle bureaucracy, and foster partnerships inside their agency or out - focused by their guiding principle: aut viam inveniam aut faciam &mdash; either find a way or make one. </p>

    <p>The experience that each fellow has is different, but in the end, their work is the same: do the hard thing, do the right thing, and serve the interests of the people of the United States and the world.</p>

      <p>Data.gov provides access to over 100,000 federal data sets. Like many PIF projects, the source code of this federated data portal was developed from its inception as an open source project, as well as leveraging other open source code to accelerate development.</p>

      <p>Millions of Americans can get easy, secure online access to their health records thanks to “Blue Button”.

      <p>The Smithsonian held its first ever hackathon, helping the American Art Museum reimagine the digital kiosks at the Luce Center, resulting in visionary short films and working prototypes.
