He experimented with other stage activities: acting, directing, designing the sound, writing and playing music for plays. In college he analyzed data to inform Paul Epstien's introduction of heatlh consequences into the global warming conversation of the late nineties. As a young adult, he provided strategy and software to city and state governments that helped them fund the services they provide residents, including a succesful five year plan to move DC from the red to the black. In the early Internet he saw a new stage and felt incredible enthusiasm for what people could make of it. Over fourteen years, he co-founded three digital entertainment companies. These companies pioneered the ecosystem that empowers creatives to prosper independently (see GarageBand). Now as an adult he organizes creatives for social justice and civic impact including a community that hosted a 2014 Presidential town hall on the millennial economy.

This design ethos evolved out of the need to handle the complexity of extraordinarily wide, deep and complicated service delivery environments, such as deep space exploration and settlement, and establishing pluralistic worldviews in war-zones, and the hunger to deliver deeply human experiences with precision and artistry.\n\nHe’s built international brands from the ground up with proceeds in excess of $50m/yr, introduced brands to new cultures, and anchored greenfield organizational strategies for some of the most influential platforms in the world. First introduced to brand and design by Alex Bogusky (CP+B) and John Beilenberg (Project M) at the Fearless Cottage, he was involved in the ‘design for good movement’ early on. Always exploring the potential of visual storytelling and new media for social change, he is currently working on ‘The Genesis Project’ with Iconoclast/Anonymous Content, a series of art activations and short form non-fiction stories that dimensionalize, elevate, and expose the complex relationship we as a civilization have with water. As a result of a mass casualty attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh he began a pursuit into the counter-violent-extremism space and has since developed extensive counter-terrorism experience in Southeast Asia via the organization he co-founded, Hellen&#124;Herald.  As an independent studio designer and trained architect, he was the principal inventor, alongside NIKE Innovation, of the Concord Harness, a helixed-exoskeletal undergarment de­veloped for TEAM USA to increase the longevity of para­plegic athletes during periods of extreme fatigue, ultimately worn by medal winning teams in the Paralympics.\n\nHe is a frequent speaker on the value of design and has lectured at Harvard Business School and contributed as Program Faculty at Yale Executive School of Management.",

Yll partnered with senior stakeholders to scope, develop and deliver new innovative approaches to incorporating data science into aspects of healthcare operations and clinical decision making. He oversaw the development and use of algorithms and statistical predictive models to evaluate health outcomes. He led teams in determining analytical approaches and modeling techniques. Supported clients in extracting insights out of structured and unstructured data to solve complex business problems by relying on statistical techniques and broad knowledge of healthcare systems. \n\nIn 2019, parallel to his work, Yll designed a digital solution to monitor and display real-time messages to audiences based on demographic characteristics, setting such as time of day, using machine learning platforms (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV). He placed first at the the Universidad Adolfo Ibanez, Chile Prototypes Challenge and a finalist at the Virginia Tech 2019 Global Entrepreneur Challenge.   \n\nWhile at Booz Allen Hamilton, Yll et al. built the “Chronic Disease and Healthcare Cost Predictor” a personal disability predictor tool: a tool to model the probability of disease using user data and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Another of Yll’s creations was the “Heath 2 Head Voting Comparator,\"\" a web tool developed as part of National Library Contest that allows users to compare the voting records of any two Senators or Congress members, tracking the bills or topics on which may agree. Prior to that, Yll’s little app called QuickQuestion, an app that helps you answer life’s questions, both big and small, lived on the app stores, yet never taking off. \n\nYll holds a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Prishtina, Kosovo, and a Masters in Public Health, a Masters in Epidemiology and a Ph.D. in Public Health, all from the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.",
